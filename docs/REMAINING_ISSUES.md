## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority

#### Issue #1: Large File Performance
**Status**: 🟡 Open  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Affects**: Files >100MB

**Description**:
Processing PDFs larger than 100MB can take 10-20 seconds, causing the UI to feel unresponsive during processing.

**Current Workaround**:
- Users can upload files up to 200MB, but should expect longer processing times
- Progress indicator shows activity

**Planned Fix** (v1.3.0):
- Implement streaming document processing
- Add chunked upload for large files
- Display more granular progress (e.g., "Processing page 45/200")

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Current: Process entire document at once
async uploadDocument(file: File) {
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer(); // Blocks until complete
  // ...
}

// Planned: Stream processing
async uploadDocument(file: File) {
  const stream = file.stream();
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    await this.processChunk(chunk);
    this.updateProgress();
  }
}
```

#### Issue #2: Memory Usage with Many Documents
**Status**: 🟡 Open  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Affects**: 8+ large documents

**Description**:
Loading 10 large PDFs (50MB+ each) can consume 400-500MB of browser memory, potentially causing slowdowns on lower-end devices.

**Current Workaround**:
- Recommend uploading 5 or fewer documents at once
- Close unused documents to free memory

**Planned Fix** (v1.3.0):
- Implement lazy loading for PDF pages
- Add document unloading feature
- Optimize memory usage in react-pdf

**Impact**:
- Low-end devices (4GB RAM): May experience slowdowns
- Mid-range devices (8GB RAM): No issues
- High-end devices (16GB+ RAM): No issues

---

#### Issue #3: Semantic Search Accuracy
**Status**: 🟡 Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Affects**: Complex queries

**Description**:
Semantic search occasionally returns false positives when searching for very abstract concepts or when documents contain ambiguous language.

**Example**:
- Query: "risk management strategies"
- May return: General "management" sections unrelated to risk

**Current Workaround**:
- Use more specific queries
- Combine multiple search terms
- Manually filter results

**Planned Fix** (v1.3.0):
- Improve AI prompt engineering for better context understanding
- Add relevance scoring threshold
- Implement user feedback mechanism

---

### Medium Priority

#### Issue #4: PDF Viewer - Text Selection
**Status**: 🟡 Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Affects**: Text copy/paste

**Description**:
Text selection in the PDF viewer can be finicky, especially at higher zoom levels or with complex layouts.

**Current Workaround**:
- Zoom to 100% for easier selection
- Use browser's PDF viewer for extensive copying

**Planned Fix** (v1.3.1):
- Upgrade react-pdf to latest version
- Implement custom text layer rendering
- Add "Copy Page Text" button

---

#### Issue #5: Search History
**Status**: 🟠 Not Started  
**Severity**: Low  
**Feature Request**: Yes

**Description**:
Users cannot easily access their previous searches within a session.

**Planned Enhancement** (v1.3.0):
- Add search history dropdown
- Store last 10 searches
- Quick re-run of previous searches

---

#### Issue #6: Export Results
**Status**: 🟠 Not Started  
**Severity**: Low  
**Feature Request**: Yes

**Description**:
No way to export search results for reference or sharing.

**Planned Enhancement** (v1.4.0):
- Export to PDF with highlighted pages
- Export to JSON/CSV with citations
- Copy all results to clipboard

---

### Low Priority

#### Issue #7: Dark Mode Support
**Status**: 🟠 Not Started  
**Severity**: Low  
**Feature Request**: Yes

**Description**:
Application doesn't adapt to system dark mode preference.

**Planned Enhancement** (v1.4.0):
- Detect system color scheme
- Add manual toggle
- Dark-optimized PDF viewer

---

#### Issue #8: Internationalization
**Status**: 🟠 Not Started  
**Severity**: Low  
**Feature Request**: Yes

**Description**:
UI is English-only, limiting non-English users.

**Planned Enhancement** (v1.5.0):
- Add i18n framework
- Support for 5+ languages
- RTL layout support for Arabic/Hebrew

---

## 🚧 Limitations

### Technical Limitations

#### PDF Format Restrictions
**Status**: By Design  
**Will Not Fix**

**Description**:
- Only PDFs with text layers supported
- Scanned images without OCR cannot be searched
- Password-protected PDFs not supported
- Forms and interactive PDFs may have issues

**Why**:
OCR processing requires additional services and would significantly increase processing time and cost.

**Alternatives**:
- Use Adobe Acrobat to add OCR
- Convert images to text-layer PDFs first
- Use dedicated OCR tools

---

#### Browser Compatibility
**Status**: By Design  
**Will Not Fix**

**Description**:
- Internet Explorer 11 not supported
- Older browsers (Chrome <90, Firefox <88) not supported
- Mobile Safari has minor rendering issues

**Why**:
Modern features (ES6+, Web APIs) required for performance.

**Alternatives**:
- Update to modern browser
- Use desktop application (future)

---

#### File Size Limits
**Status**: By Design  
**May Adjust**

**Description**:
- Maximum file size: 200MB
- Maximum files: 10

**Why**:
- Browser memory constraints
- API rate limits
- Processing time concerns

**Future**:
May increase limits based on user feedback and technical improvements.

---

### AI Model Limitations

#### Language Support
**Status**: AI Model Limitation  
**Partial Fix Possible**

**Description**:
Best performance with English documents. Other languages supported but may have reduced accuracy.

**Affected Languages**:
- Non-Latin scripts: Lower accuracy
- Technical jargon: May misinterpret
- Mixed languages: Context confusion

**Mitigation** (v1.4.0):
- Add language detection
- Optimize prompts per language
- Support language-specific models

---

#### Context Window
**Status**: AI Model Limitation  
**Cannot Fix**

**Description**:
Gemini 2.5 Flash has context limits. Very long documents may need chunking, potentially losing cross-page context.

**Impact**:
- Documents >500 pages: May miss connections
- Complex queries across many pages: Reduced accuracy

**Workaround**:
- Split very large documents
- Use more specific page-range queries

---
